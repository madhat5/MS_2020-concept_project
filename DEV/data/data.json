The variety of rose depicted on the dress is the American Beauty, which has led to it being called the \"American Beauty\" dress. The bodice of the dress is sleeveless, with a scoop neck front, princess seams and a deep \"v\" in the back reaching to the waist. The skirt of the dress has a flat front, and the skirt gathers toward the center-back waist with box pleats to create a small bustle silhouette. Green silk vines and leaves, covered in two-toned pink rose blooms and buds, begin at each front shoulder above the bust, cover both shoulders, and run along the edges of the open back bodice to the center back. On the proper right side, one (1) small vine continues below the waist and wraps around the hip to the front of the skirt. On the proper left side, two (2) longer vines continue below the waist and wrap around to the front of the skirt, the longest ending just above the hemline and wrapping all the way around to the proper right front. The dress closes up the center back with a silver zipper that begins below the center back waist and ends above the waist. Two (2) large roses in full bloom are attached at the center back waist."},{"label":"Description","content":"The interior of the bodice is lined with ivory fabric. In the front and back of the bodice, boning is sewn at regular intervals to provide structure and shaping. Individual breast cups are shaped into the cut of the garment. A thin piece of elastic, attached in three places at the proper left, center front and proper right, provides support underneath the bust line. Thin shoulder straps made of the same material as the lining are tacked to the interior of the outer straps. A wider elastic band is tacked at the center front and closes in the center back with two hook-and-eyes to provide further bust support. An interior waistband of cream grosgrain ribbon is tacked to the interior waistline and closes at the center back with two (2) hook-and-eyes. The interior of the skirt is lined with light cream silk knit. The skirt has one (1) petticoat, made of ivory faille and lined with heavy linen that attaches to the waist at the center back with a hook-and-eye. The bottom of the petticoat has a tulle ruffle and is edged with stiffener."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of the Black Fashion Museum founded by Lois K.

The artificial plant and light are in a large pot constructed of chrome sheet metal wrapped into a circle and finished with metal trim along the top edge, bottom edge, and seam. There are five (5) rubber feet on the bottom of the pot. The electrical cord runs out of the base of the potted plant, near the pot seam."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Cassandra Fay Smith"}],"name":[{"label":"Created by","content":"Unidentified"},{"label":"Used by","content":"Isaiah Muse, American, 1919 - 2012"}],"topic":[{"label":"Topic","content":"African American"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Domestic life"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Nightlife"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Segregation"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Social life and customs"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Urban life"}],"place":[{"label":"Place used","content":"South Shore, Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, United States, North and Central America"}],"physicalDescription":[{"label":"Medium","content":"plastic, metal and rubber"},{"label":"Dimensions","content":"H x W: 65 x 10 in.

The front bodice and neckline are embellished with ivory and metallic floral lace that is further hand decorated with faux pearl beads and metallic sequins. Panels of the lace trim the neck and outline a stomacher-type center front bodice, reaching a point at the center front waist. A single panel of lace is also sewn on the outer side of each sleeve, with the cuffs trimmed in lace. A pre-tied ivory satin bow without tails is tacked at the outer side of each cuff. The skirt is gathered and tacked down at each front side thigh to reveal a heavily embellished petticoat. Both the skirt and the petticoat have a train at the back. The passementerie decorating the petticoat is arranged in tiers and includes the same floral ivory and metallic lace used on the bodice also decorated in beads and sequins, rosettes made from ivory satin, and gold colored fringe. The bottom hem of the petticoat has rounded deep cut outs resembling petals all the way around, with a pleated ivory ruffle sewn underneath the cut outs. The top front edges of the skirt are tacked down at the waist, then folded outward and sewn down at each front side thigh with the sequined and beaded floral lace covering the seams, each piece of the lace backed in the satin and with short strands of faux pearl fringe hanging from the tips. Flowers from a larger piece of metallic floral lace have been fussy cut and then sewn in a random scattered pattern onto the skirt around the sides and back. The back of the skirt has deep pleats at the center back waist to accommodate a bustle.

Hinged top lid that swings up and towards the back. Two (2) rectangular silver latches, on silver lock risers, with a vertical hasp (fastened to the lid, but connects to the lock riser on the body of the briefcase). Hasps are closest to the center (mirror each other), and the slide element (circular protruding buttons that you slide inward toward the middle of the briefcase to pop open the hasps) are closest to the edge. Text etched into a circle on the underside of the silver hasps reads [MADE IN USA]. Each lock is approx. 3 x 3\" in size (including latches).On the reverse, there are two (2) silver floral-like silver hinges, connecting the lid to the body of the case. The hinges appear almost like a mirrored image of a leaf, with three points on both the top and bottom, and are about 1 3/4 x 1 3/8\" in size, each. On the bottom of the case, there are four (4) silver studs acting as feet to keep the case from sliding or moving, one in each corner of the rectangular bottom. Each study is approx. 1/2\" in diameter. There is a moveable handle on the top center of the lid. The handle is a plastic post handle in style, creating a kind of half semi-circle (but more squared off) connected at both ends to metal elements creating movement for the handle and connecting it the case lid. The elements connecting the handle to the lid are silver, but the handle itself is black plastic, and is approx. 6 1/4 x 3/4 x 2 1/2\" tall (when standing straight up). The interior of the case is lined with a floral patterned wall-paper style paper, all black, and slightly glossy. There is a black metal element on the interior center of the lid (the interior connection for the handle). There is a metal container/bin fastened to the PR interior of the case, at the top, that is approx. 6 1/4 x 2 1/2 x 2 3/8\" in size. It is fastened onto the side of the case with two silver screws. There is a smaller and shallower bin inside the main bin (possibly for keeping track of smaller things - like needles and pins), with a zig-zag right edge. Behind the metal bin are two metal pieces coming out from the PR side of the case, forming a circle together (almost like tongs). Along the very bottom PR of the interior of the case, there is a wooden block, painted black, a little over 3\" in width and 1/2\" in height fastened along the bottom."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Gaston L.

Three (3) original joists remain between the first and second levels of the house. Inside the house, at center back, painted wood planks form a partition wall. Behind the partition wall are stairs leading to the former second level. Below the stairs is a small closet space accessible through a white-painted door in the partition wall. A small section of original chinking has been installed in between timbers on the second story interior wall of the house. The lower timbers of the house, having been directly exposed to the soil for decades, required full or partial replacement.

The wooden and metal plates at the top of the left and right shafts are identical. The exterior sides of the top plates have been finished with two bands of inlaid metal resembling rope. Between the bands there is an alternating pattern of decorative brass tacks and larger white-coated, round bores holes that expose the metal plates beneath the wood. Inside the decorative bands near the center of the plates, are paper disks, inscribed in Hebrew and covered with protective clear, plastic film disks that have been secured in place with brass nails. At the top of the left roller, the finial is missing due to loss and has been wrapped in white, cloth tape. The spindle-shaped finial of the right roller is a wooden peg, covered with a length of metal tubing and three differently colored spindle-turned elements. The finials at the bottom of the Torah are both spindle shaped with matching plates but mismatched spindle-shaped handles. The left handle is darker than the right, has a different design and is shorter in length than the right handle."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture; Gift of Rabbi Capers Funnye and the Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation"}],"name":[{"label":"Created by","content":"Unidentified"},{"label":"Owned by","content":"Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation, American, founded 1984"}],"topic":[{"label":"Topic","content":"African American"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Identity"},{"label":"Topic","content":"Religious groups"}],"place":[{"label":"Place used","content":"Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, United States, North and Central America"},{"label":"Place made","content":"Poland, Europe"}],"physicalDescription":[{"label":"Medium","content":"wood and ink on parchment and sinew with alloy steel, brass, metal, paper and plastic"},{"label":"Dimensions","content":"37 11/16 × 14 3/4 × 6 11/16 in.

With Dorsey as its music director, the church became known as the birthplace of gospel music. Albertina Walker, Mahalia Jackson, Sallie Martin, Aretha Franklin, James Cleveland, The Staple Singers and The Edwin Hawkins singers are among those who have sung at the church. Famous members of the congregation include Bessie Coleman. When Pilgrim purchased new instruments for its music program, this piano was given to Pastor Austin. It would be played by Dorsey and others when they visited his home."},{"label":"Description","content":"This piano is paneled with wood and structured around a cast iron frame.

H. Van Evrie, a hardbound book covered in blue leather. The cover itself is blank, the spine of the book has the title [WHITE / SUPREMACY / and / NEGRO / SUBORDINATION / VAN EVRIE] in gold lettering with a makers stamp on the bottom that state [VE&Co]. There are approximately 410 pages. The stated intention of the book is to demonstrate “that the so-called slavery of the South was the Negro’s normal or natural condition.” Evrie cites phrenology, physical anthropology, comparative anatomy, and biological determinism in support of the argument that the enslaved were absolutely dependent on their masters. The work begins with a page of four illustrated figures and page numbers. Throughout the book, there are six colored lithographs depicting stereotypical figures of different races. The first illustration on page 16 is a man standing on a colorful tiled floor with Washington, D.C. in the background and is titled [CAUCASIAN]. The other lithographs are not titled. On page 67, an African figure is pictured wearing a loose white garment with swords tucked into a red sash. Behind the individual is a desert background. The third illustration, on page 89, is a color plate depicting an Asian indvidual holding a smoking pipe with a long shaft, standing next to a bamboo table, with mountains and a pagoda in the background. On page 221, an American Indian figure is depicted wearing a beaded and feathered headdress and animal skin leggings with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He carries a spear and stands on a rock. An Eskimo figure is shown on page 269. He is depicted wearing fur garments and holding an ice fishing spear, with snow covered mountains in the background. The last illustration plate on page 308 depicts a black man seated and smoking a pipe. He wears red striped pants that are soiled and torn at the knee, a white shirt and tan vest. He is barefoot. The tall masts of ships are visible in the background. The back of the book includes pages of advertisements for other works including those published by Van Evrie, Horton & Co."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of Thomas P.

The bodice is sleeveless with a scooped neckline and an empire waist. It is made from the border section of a sari featuring heavy metallic brocade in a geometric design, with the embroidered leaves from a sari border fussy cut from the fabric and sewn around the waist line, the bottom edges left loose to create a three-dimensional detail. The floor-length skirt has a flat front and is slightly gathered at the back. It is made from a sari that has an all-over design of metallic brocaded stylized leaves scattered at wide intervals with blank spaces between them. The edge of the skirt hem is trimmed in a sari border with a stylized floral and geometric metallic brocade design. Individual small metallic brocade leaves fussy cut from a larger sari fabric are sewn onto the skirt near the larger brocaded leaves of the skirt fabric. The dress closes at the center back with a zipper and one (1) metal hook-and-eye. Attached along the back top edge of the bodice is a panel of the same sari fabric used on the skirt that is separate from the back of the dress, extending down to meet the hemline of the skirt. The panel is gathered and seamed along the top edge of the bodice, with a slit cut in the back bodice corresponding to the zipper closure of the dress underneath. This slit is fastened shut with two (2) metal hooks into thread loops. The side and bottom edges of the panel are trimmed in the same sari border used to trim the skirt hem.

The main fabric is a plain weave natural fiber fabric with a cream ground and a repeating pattern of small four-petal flowers in red, purple, blue, and tan. The skirt is predominantly hand-sewn. It has a waistband made from an undyed bast fiber fabric with the floral print gathered and whip stitched to the waistband. The skirt is more closely gathered on the back. There is a slit at the center back that divides the waistband completely. There is no attached closure method, but rust staining at the back opening of the waistband suggests the skirt was pinned to close. The bottom of the skirt has an extra flounce of the floral print that has a series of pleats around the skirt in sets of three alternating with straight sections. This flounce is machine-sewn at the top and 1 1/2 inches from the bottom using blue thread that is possibly a synthetic fiber. The bottom and top edges of the flounce are bound with blue fabric sewn on the bias. The interior of the skirt is lined only behind the extra flounce with a hand-pinked undyed bast fiber fabric. There is a previous repair on the back proper right side of the skirt where a panel of light brown synthetic fabric is hand sewn on the interior of the skirt from the gathering at the waist to the top of the older linen lining on the bottom."}],"creditLine":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gift of the Black Fashion Museum founded by Lois K.
